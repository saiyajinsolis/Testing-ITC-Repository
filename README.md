Testing out the idea of creating a github repository for the club holding the constitution and other details relating to officer roles, club purpose, story, elections, etc.


I've begun adding in folders to hold the constitution within a github repository.

As I work with things and begin to think about it all. This might throw some people off. Especially when realizing that certain changes to a repository will need to be branched in to keep from having people modifying the constitution freely within this repository. 

When considering that going this route would then go on to require the consistent monitoring of every branch that gives a merge request not syncing with the votes of another merge request. This might lead to a lot of confusion. 

Its still a great idea. In practice maybe if the votes where casted as people creating their own seperate txt with the names of the people they voted for on it.
